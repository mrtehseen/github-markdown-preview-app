# Markdown Previewer - A GitHub flavored Markdown

When markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text as a [placeholder].
